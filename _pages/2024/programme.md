| 11:00–11:45 | **Invited Talk 1**<br> <br> Title: Beyond Performance: The Evolving Landscape of Human Evaluation<br>by **Sheila Castilho**, ADAPT/DCU<br> <br> <em>In the field of MT/NLP evaluation, the focus has traditionally been on system performance metrics. However, as language technology continues to evolve, the methodologies for evaluation must evolve as well. One of the main concerns with the rise of LLMs is the data used for training these systems. The use of vast amounts of synthetic and recycled data poses inherent risks of perpetuating biases and harms in the systems, while also contributing to the stagnation of language diversity. These consequences extend beyond mere performance metrics, impacting language vitality and cultural representation. Human evaluation emerges as a critical tool in identifying and mitigating these risks, promoting fairness, inclusivity, and linguistic diversity in system outputs. This talk will delve into how human evaluation is, more than ever, playing a crucial role in addressing these issues and informing the development of more expressive and contextually relevant translations.</em><br> | <img src="/assets/images/Sheila Castilho - fit.png" alt="ALT: Invited speaker propic" width="1500" height="2100"> |

| 16:30–17:15 | **Invited Talk 2**<br> <br> Title: All That Agrees Is Not Gold: Evaluating Ground Truth and Conversational Safety <br>by **Mark J Díaz**, Google Research<be><br> <br> <em>Conversational safety as a task is complex, in part because ‘safety’ entails a broad range of topics and concerns, such as toxicity, harm, and legal concerns. Yet, machine learning approaches often require training and evaluation datasets with a clear separation between positive and negative examples. This requirement overly simplifies the natural subjectivity present in many tasks, and obscures the inherent diversity in human perceptions and opinions about many content items. This talk will demonstrate the inherent, sociocultural challenges of conversational AI safety and highlight the DICES (Diversity In Conversational AI Evaluation for Safety) dataset. The dataset contains fine-grained annotator demographic information, high replication of ratings per item, and encodes annotator votes as distributions across different demographics to allow for in-depth explorations of label aggregation strategies. In addition to describing the development of the dataset, this talk will cover past and ongoing mixed methods analyses of annotator variance, safety ambiguity, and annotator diversity in the context of safety for conversational AI.</em><br><br>**NOTE**: Due to unforeseen circumstances, Mark J Díaz will not be able to deliver this talk. Instead, it will be given by Ding Wang. <br> | <img src="/assets/images/Mark J Díaz - fit.png" alt="ALT: Invited speaker propic" width="1500" height="2100"> |
